        <div class="question">What is the Gospel?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            The Gospel is the "good news" of Jesus Christ — that through His death and resurrection, sinners can be reconciled to God by grace through faith. 
            As the Apostle Paul wrote: <em>"For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures"</em> (1 Corinthians 15:3-4, ESV). 
            The Gospel is not merely advice but a divine proclamation of what God has accomplished in Christ (Romans 1:16–17).

    <div class="qa-item">
        <div class="question">What does it mean to be "born again"?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            To be "born again" (Greek: <em>anōthen</em>, "from above") is to experience the spiritual regeneration that comes from the Holy Spirit (John 3:3–8). 
            This new birth is not a moral self-improvement project but the sovereign work of God, who gives a new heart and spirit (Ezekiel 36:26–27). 
            As Paul says, <em>"if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come"</em> (2 Corinthians 5:17).
