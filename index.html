            <div class="question">1. What is the Gospel according to Scripture?</div>
            <div class="answer">The Gospel is the good news that Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God, came into the world to save sinners (1 Tim. 1:15). Through His sinless life, substitutionary death on the cross, and victorious resurrection, He offers forgiveness of sins and reconciliation with God to all who repent and believe (Mark 1:15; Rom. 5:8; 1 Cor. 15:3-4).</div>
        </section>
        <section class="qa">
            <div class="question">2. Why is sound doctrine important for the believer?</div>
            <div class="answer">Sound doctrine safeguards the church from error, equips believers for discernment, and nurtures maturity in Christ (Eph. 4:14-15; 1 Tim. 4:16). Without it, the faith can be distorted, leading people away from the truth of God's Word.</div>
        </section>
        <section class="qa">
            <div class="question">3. How can we know the Bible is the Word of God?</div>
            <div class="answer">The Bible is the inspired, inerrant Word of God (2 Tim. 3:16-17). Its historical accuracy, fulfilled prophecy, internal consistency, and transforming power testify to its divine origin. Jesus Himself affirmed the Scriptures as God's Word (John 10:35; Matt. 5:18).</div>

        <section class="qa">
            <div class="question">4. What is repentance?</div>
            <div class="answer">Repentance is a Spirit-enabled turning from sin to God. It involves a change of mind, heart, and direction, resulting in a life that seeks to obey Christ (Acts 3:19; 2 Cor. 7:10).</div>
        </section>
        <section class="qa">
            <div class="question">5. Who is Jesus Christ?</div>
            <div class="answer">Jesus Christ is the eternal Son of God, fully God and fully man (John 1:1,14). Conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary, He lived without sin, performed miracles, taught with divine authority, died for our sins, rose again, and will return to judge the living and the dead.</div>
