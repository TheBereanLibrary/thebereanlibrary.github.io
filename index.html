        <section class="qa">
            <div class="question">1. What is the Gospel according to Scripture?</div>
            <div class="answer">The Gospel is the good news that Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God, came into the world to save sinners (1 Tim. 1:15). Through His sinless life, substitutionary death on the cross, and victorious resurrection, He offers forgiveness of sins and reconciliation with God to all who repent and believe (Mark 1:15; Rom. 5:8; 1 Cor. 15:3-4).</div>
        </section>
        <section class="qa">
            <div class="question">2. Why is sound doctrine important for the believer?</div>
            <div class="answer">Sound doctrine safeguards the church from error, equips believers for discernment, and nurtures maturity in Christ (Eph. 4:14-15; 1 Tim. 4:16). Without it, the faith can be distorted, leading people away from the truth of God's Word.</div>
        </section>
        <section class="qa">
            <div class="question">3. How can we know the Bible is the Word of God?</div>
            <div class="answer">The Bible is the inspired, inerrant Word of God (2 Tim. 3:16-17). Its historical accuracy, fulfilled prophecy, internal consistency, and transforming power testify to its divine origin. Jesus Himself affirmed the Scriptures as God's Word (John 10:35; Matt. 5:18).</div>
        </section>
        <section class="qa">
            <div class="question">4. What is repentance?</div>
            <div class="answer">Repentance is a Spirit-enabled turning from sin to God. It involves a change of mind, heart, and direction, resulting in a life that seeks to obey Christ (Acts 3:19; 2 Cor. 7:10).</div>
        </section>
        <section class="qa">
            <div class="question">5. Who is Jesus Christ?</div>
            <div class="answer">Jesus Christ is the eternal Son of God, fully God and fully man (John 1:1,14). Conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary, He lived without sin, performed miracles, taught with divine authority, died for our sins, rose again, and will return to judge the living and the dead.</div>

  <h2>Doctrine &amp; Theology — Cornerstone Q&amp;A</h2>
  <p style="color:#555;margin-top:.25rem">Concise, biblically grounded answers with key Scripture references and classic guardrails.</p>
  <hr style="margin:1rem 0" />

  <!-- Q1 -->
  <article style="margin:1.25rem 0">
    <h3>1) What is the Trinity, and how is it grounded in Scripture?</h3>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The one true God eternally exists in three distinct Persons—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—each fully and equally God, not three gods nor mere modes, but one divine essence in three Persons. The Father begets the Son; the Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son. The works of God are undivided, fittingly appropriated to each Person.</p>
    <p><em>Key texts:</em> Deut 6:4; Matt 28:19; John 1:1–18; 14–16; 2 Cor 13:14.</p>
    <p><em>Guardrails:</em> Reject tritheism (three gods) and modalism (one person with three masks).</p>
    <p><em>Why it matters:</em> Salvation is from the Father, through the Son, by the Spirit; Christian worship is inherently Trinitarian.</p>
  </article>

  <!-- Q2 -->
  <article style="margin:1.25rem 0">
    <h3>2) What are God’s attributes (incommunicable &amp; communicable)?</h3>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Incommunicable attributes (aseity, simplicity, immutability, infinity, omnipresence, omniscience, omnipotence) mark God’s uniqueness; communicable attributes (holiness, justice, goodness, love, mercy, truth, wisdom) are reflected in creatures analogically. God is simple (not composed of parts); His attributes are identical with His being.</p>
    <p><em>Key texts:</em> Exod 3:14; Ps 90:2; Mal 3:6; Ps 139; 1 John 4:8; Exod 34:6–7; Rom 11:33–36.</p>
    <p><em>Guardrails:</em> Avoid treating attributes as parts, or implying God changes in His being/purposes.</p>
    <p><em>Why it matters:</em> Confidence in prayer and worship rests on who God is—unchanging, all-wise, perfectly good.</p>
  </article>

  <!-- Q3 -->
  <article style="margin:1.25rem 0">
    <h3>3) What is divine providence, and how does it relate to human freedom?</h3>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Providence is God’s preservation, concurrence, and government of all things. He ordains whatsoever comes to pass without being the author of sin or overriding real creaturely agency.</p>
    <p><em>Key texts:</em> Ps 104; Prov 16:9; Matt 10:29–31; Acts 17:24–28; Gen 50:20; Eph 1:11.</p>
    <p><em>Guardrails:</em> Reject fatalism (denies responsibility) and deism (denies God’s active care). Historic compatibilism affirms both sovereignty and responsibility (Acts 2:23).</p>
    <p><em>Why it matters:</em> Grounds assurance in suffering and fuels active, prayerful obedience.</p>
  </article>

  <!-- Q4 -->
  <article style="margin:1.25rem 0">
    <h3>4) What does it mean that humans are made in the image of God (imago Dei)?</h3>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Humanity—male and female—bears God’s image with dignity, relational capacity, moral agency, and a vocation to represent God by filling, ruling, and cultivating creation. The image is marred by sin yet renewed in Christ.</p>
    <p><em>Key texts:</em> Gen 1:26–28; 2:15; 9:6; Ps 8; Eph 4:24; Col 3:10; Jas 3:9.</p>
    <p><em>Guardrails:</em> Don’t reduce the image to reason alone or dominion alone; it is holistic. The fall distorts, not erases.</p>
    <p><em>Why it matters:</em> Grounds human dignity, clarifies vocation, and frames justice and mercy.</p>
  </article>

  <!-- Q5 -->
  <article style="margin:1.25rem 0">
    <h3>5) What is the fall and original sin?</h3>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> In Adam, humanity fell from original righteousness; we inherit guilt and a corrupt nature inclined to evil. Apart from grace we are spiritually dead and unable to turn to God.</p>
    <p><em>Key texts:</em> Gen 3; Ps 51:5; Rom 3:9–20; 5:12–21; Eph 2:1–3.</p>
    <p><em>Guardrails:</em> Reject Pelagianism (humans born morally neutral). Responsibility remains; grace truly renews.</p>
    <p><em>Why it matters:</em> A right diagnosis makes the **grace-alone** gospel necessary and glorious.</p>
  </article>

  <!-- Q6 -->
  <article style="margin:1.25rem 0">
    <h3>6) Who is Jesus Christ? (the person of Christ)</h3>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The eternal Son assumed a complete human nature in the incarnation, remaining one person in two natures—divine and human—without confusion, change, division, or separation. True God and true man, He is the sole mediator.</p>
    <p><em>Key texts:</em> John 1:1–14; Phil 2:5–11; Col 1:15–20; Heb 1–2; 1 Tim 2:5.</p>
    <p><em>Guardrails:</em> Reject Arianism, Apollinarianism, Nestorianism, and Eutychianism.</p>
    <p><em>Why it matters:</em> Only God-with-us can save; only a true man can represent and redeem us.</p>
  </article>

  <!-- Q7 -->
  <article style="margin:1.25rem 0">
    <h3>7) What did Christ accomplish in His death and resurrection? (atonement)</h3>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The cross and resurrection secure penal substitution (bearing our guilt and curse to satisfy divine justice), victory over sin/death/Satan, ransom/redemption, reconciliation, and exemplar love—Scripture presents these facets with penal substitution at the doctrinal core of justification.</p>
    <p><em>Key texts:</em> Isa 52:13–53:12; Mark 10:45; Rom 3:21–26; 5:6–11; 8:1–4; 2 Cor 5:21; Col 2:13–15; 1 Pet 2:24; 3:18.</p>
    <p><em>Guardrails:</em> More than moral influence; and never a cold transaction—salvation is the work of the Triune God.</p>
    <p><em>Why it matters:</em> Assurance rests on Christ’s objective, finished work.</p>
  </article>

  <!-- Q8 -->
  <article style="margin:1.25rem 0">
    <h3>8) Who is the Holy Spirit and what is His work?</h3>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The Spirit is the third Person of the Trinity, fully God, proceeding from the Father and the Son. He regenerates, indwells, sanctifies, assures, illumines Scripture, unites us to Christ, and distributes gifts for the Church’s edification and mission.</p>
    <p><em>Key texts:</em> John 3:5–8; 14–16; Rom 8; 1 Cor 2:10–14; 12–14; Gal 5:16–26; Eph 1:13–14; Titus 3:5–6.</p>
    <p><em>Guardrails:</em> He is a Person, not an impersonal force; illumination is not new canonical revelation; gifts must edify in order and love (1 Cor 14).</p>
    <p><em>Why it matters:</em> Without the Spirit there is no new birth, holiness, unity, or power for mission.</p>
  </article>

  <!-- Q9 -->
  <article style="margin:1.25rem 0">
    <h3>9) What is Holy Scripture? (revelation, inspiration, canon, sufficiency)</h3>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> God’s special revelation is inscripturated in the 66-book canon of the Old and New Testaments. Scripture is God-breathed, true in all it affirms, and sufficient for faith and practice. The Church recognized (did not create) the canon as apostolic/prophetic writings bearing divine qualities and corporate reception.</p>
    <p><em>Key texts:</em> 2 Tim 3:16–17; 2 Pet 1:19–21; Ps 19; John 10:35; Luke 24:27,44–47; Heb 1:1–2.</p>
    <p><em>Guardrails:</em> Scripture is the norming norm; tradition is a witness, not a rival. Canon is complete; the Spirit illumines what He has breathed out.</p>
    <p><em>Why it matters:</em> Discipleship rests on a trustworthy Word; sufficiency guards against adding or subtracting from God’s speech.</p>
  </article>

  <!-- Q10 -->
  <article style="margin:1.25rem 0">
    <h3>10) How does God save sinners? (union with Christ &amp; the order of salvation)</h3>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> United to Christ by the Spirit, sinners are effectually called, regenerated, granted repentance and faith, justified (imputed righteousness), adopted, sanctified (definitive & progressive), preserved, and glorified. Union with Christ is the organizing center: in Him we die to sin and rise to new life.</p>
    <p><em>Key texts:</em> Rom 8:28–30; John 6:37–40; 15:1–11; Eph 1:3–14; 2:1–10; Gal 2:20; Titus 3:3–7; Phil 1:6.</p>
    <p><em>Guardrails:</em> Justification by faith alone; sanctification is distinct but inseparable; God preserves His people while real warnings summon endurance.</p>
    <p><em>Why it matters:</em> Protects grace, fuels holiness, and anchors assurance in Christ’s finished work and the Spirit’s ongoing work.</p>

  <hr style="margin:1rem 0" />

  <!-- Q1 -->
  <article style="margin:1.25rem 0">
    <h3>1) How can we know God exists?</h3>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> God’s existence is revealed in creation (general revelation), conscience, and supremely in Christ and Scripture (special revelation). Classical theistic arguments—cosmological (contingency), teleological (design), moral (objective moral values), ontological (maximally great being)—are supportive but God is ultimately known through His self-disclosure by the Spirit.</p>
    <p><em>Key texts:</em> Ps 19:1–6; Rom 1:18–23; Acts 14:15–17; 17:22–31; Heb 11:6.</p>
    <p><em>Guardrails:</em> Arguments do not replace revelation; faith is not irrational but Spirit-enabled trust in the God who has made Himself known.</p>
  </article>

  <!-- Q2 -->
  <article style="margin:1.25rem 0">
    <h3>2) If God is good, why is there evil and suffering?</h3>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> God is perfectly good, yet permits evil for wise and holy purposes—displaying His justice, mercy, and glory in ways otherwise unseen. Moral evil stems from creaturely rebellion; natural evil from the curse following the fall. In Christ, God enters suffering, bears it, and will end it in the new creation.</p>
    <p><em>Key texts:</em> Gen 50:20; Job 1–2; Isa 53; Acts 2:23; Rom 8:18–39; Rev 21:1–5.</p>
    <p><em>Guardrails:</em> Avoid portraying God as the author of sin; affirm both sovereignty and creaturely agency. The cross is the lens for God’s goodness in suffering.</p>
  </article>

  <!-- Q3 -->
  <article style="margin:1.25rem 0">
    <h3>3) Is the Bible historically reliable?</h3>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes. Manuscript evidence is abundant and early; archaeological findings often confirm biblical details; fulfilled prophecy, literary coherence, and eyewitness testimony (esp. of the resurrection) provide cumulative credibility. The Spirit’s witness brings conviction that it is God’s Word.</p>
    <p><em>Key texts:</em> Luke 1:1–4; 1 Cor 15:3–8; 2 Pet 1:16–21; Ps 119:160.</p>
    <p><em>Guardrails:</em> Reliability does not mean every question is answered; inerrancy means Scripture affirms only truth, rightly interpreted.</p>
  </article>

  <!-- Q4 -->
  <article style="margin:1.25rem 0">
    <h3>4) How can miracles be possible in a scientific age?</h3>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> If God created and sustains the universe, miracles are not violations of natural law but acts of the Creator, who is free to act beyond ordinary providence. Science describes regularities; it cannot preclude God’s special acts.</p>
    <p><em>Key texts:</em> Gen 1:1; Ps 135:6; Matt 19:26; John 20:30–31; Acts 2:22–24.</p>
    <p><em>Guardrails:</em> Don’t treat miracles as magic; they are purposeful signs pointing to God’s redemptive work.</p>
  </article>

  <!-- Q5 -->
  <article style="margin:1.25rem 0">
    <h3>5) What evidence is there for Jesus’ resurrection?</h3>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The resurrection is supported by multiple early independent testimonies, the empty tomb, post-mortem appearances to individuals and groups, the transformation of disciples, the rise of the Church, and the shift in worship to the first day. The best explanation is that Jesus truly rose bodily.</p>
    <p><em>Key texts:</em> 1 Cor 15:3–8; Matt 28; Luke 24; Acts 2:22–36.</p>
    <p><em>Guardrails:</em> Not merely a “spiritual” resurrection; Scripture presents it as bodily and historical.</p>
  </article>

  <!-- Q6 -->
  <article style="margin:1.25rem 0">
    <h3>6) How do we know Christianity is the only true way?</h3>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Jesus claimed exclusive authority (John 14:6), fulfilled unique messianic prophecy, performed public miracles, rose from the dead, and offers the only sufficient atonement. Other religions may contain moral truths but cannot reconcile sinners to God apart from Christ.</p>
    <p><em>Key texts:</em> Isa 45:21–22; John 14:6; Acts 4:12; 1 Tim 2:5–6.</p>
    <p><em>Guardrails:</em> Hold truth with humility and love; exclusivity is about the sufficiency of Christ, not cultural superiority.</p>
  </article>

  <!-- Q7 -->
  <article style="margin:1.25rem 0">
    <h3>7) How can faith and reason work together?</h3>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Faith is not irrational but trust in God based on who He is and what He has done; reason helps us understand, explain, and defend the faith. Faith seeks understanding (fides quaerens intellectum) and rests on the Spirit’s witness through God’s Word.</p>
    <p><em>Key texts:</em> Isa 1:18; Acts 17:2–4; 1 Pet 3:15; Jude 3.</p>
    <p><em>Guardrails:</em> Avoid fideism (faith with no reason) and rationalism (reason as ultimate authority).</p>
  </article>

  <!-- Q8 -->
  <article style="margin:1.25rem 0">
    <h3>8) What about those who have never heard the gospel?</h3>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> All people have general revelation and are accountable for suppressing the truth; salvation comes only through Christ. God is just and merciful, and has ordained the preaching of the gospel to all nations. We entrust such cases to His justice and urgency of mission.</p>
    <p><em>Key texts:</em> Ps 19; Rom 1:18–23; 10:9–17; Acts 4:12.</p>
    <p><em>Guardrails:</em> Avoid universalism; uphold God’s justice and mercy; let this fuel evangelism, not apathy.</p>
  </article>

  <!-- Q9 -->
  <article style="margin:1.25rem 0">
    <h3>9) Can we trust the transmission of the Bible over time?</h3>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes. Textual criticism shows the New Testament is the best-preserved work of antiquity, with thousands of manuscripts across centuries allowing reconstruction with >99% accuracy; no essential doctrine depends on a disputed text.</p>
    <p><em>Key texts:</em> Isa 40:8; Matt 5:18; 24:35; 2 Tim 3:16.</p>
    <p><em>Guardrails:</em> Recognize minor variations exist; accuracy is about faithful preservation, not identical copies.</p>
  </article>

  <!-- Q10 -->
  <article style="margin:1.25rem 0">
    <h3>10) How should Christians engage in apologetics?</h3>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> With gentleness and respect, rooted in Scripture, dependent on the Spirit, and aimed at persuasion and proclamation—not winning arguments. Apologetics serves the gospel, not pride.</p>
    <p><em>Key texts:</em> 1 Pet 3:15; Col 4:5–6; 2 Tim 2:24–26; Acts 17:16–34.</p>
    <p><em>Guardrails:</em> Avoid quarrelsomeness; the goal is to remove obstacles and present Christ clearly.</p>

  <article style="margin:1.25rem 0">
    <h3>1) Why was the Council of Nicaea (AD 325) historically necessary?</h3>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The Arian controversy denied the full deity of the Son. Nicaea convened to safeguard apostolic faith by confessing the Son as <em>homoousios</em> (“of the same essence”) with the Father. This preserved the biblical gospel: only if Christ is truly God can He truly save.</p>
    <p><em>Key texts:</em> John 1:1–3; Col 1:15–20; Heb 1:1–3; John 20:28; Matt 28:19.</p>
    <p><em>Historical notes:</em> ~318 bishops; creed drafted against Arianism; later clarified at Constantinople (381).</p>
    <p><em>Why it matters:</em> Trinitarian worship and salvation rest on Christ’s true deity.</p>

    <h3>2) What impact did the Reformation (16th c.) have on doctrine and worship?</h3>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> It re-centered the Church on Scripture alone and justification by faith alone, reformed worship (vernacular Scripture, preaching, congregational singing), and recovered the primacy of grace.</p>
    <p><em>Key texts:</em> Rom 1:16–17; 3:21–28; Eph 2:8–9; Acts 17:11.</p>
    <p><em>Historical notes:</em> Luther, Calvin, Zwingli; confessions (Augsburg, Westminster, Belgic, Heidelberg).</p>

    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Monasticism preserved texts, modeled disciplined prayer, service, and learning; later renewal movements (e.g., mendicant orders, Pietism) stressed holiness and devotion.

    <h3>10) What does “unity in essentials, liberty in non-essentials, charity in all things” mean today?</h3>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The Church seeks unity in core gospel truths (e.g., Trinity, incarnation, atonement, justification), liberty on secondary matters (forms of polity, some end-times details), and love in every debate. Biblical unity never compromises truth; charity shapes tone and method.</p>
