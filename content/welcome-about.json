  "content": "<p>Welcome to <strong>The Berean Library</strong>. This resource exists to provide believers with Scripture-centered, evangelical, non-denominational materials for Bible study, discipleship, and spiritual growth. Like the Bereans of Acts 17:11, we are called to search the Scriptures daily to see if these things are so. More content will be added here soon.</p>"
